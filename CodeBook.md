## Raw DataSet source

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

### The dataset includes the following files
- 'README.txt'
- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
- 'features.txt': List of all features.
- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 
- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 
- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 
- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 
- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 


## Transformations or work that the script performed to clean up the data
* Step 1 - You need download the raw datasource and extract. You need pass the directory name like this "UCI HAR Dataset/".
* Step 2 - Read and combine subjects ("train/subject_train.txt"; "test/subject_test.txt").
* Step 3 - Read, combine ("train/y_train.txt"; "test/y_test.txt") and combined rows decode by activity labels ("activity_labels.txt").
* Step 4 - Read, combine ("test/X_test.txt"; "train/X_train.txt") and set column names for subjects ("features.txt").
* Step 5 - Combine the whole datasets.
* Step 6 - Extract from dataset only the required columns like "-mean()" and "-std()".
* Step 7 - Compute the means, grouped by activity/subject.
* Step 8 - Writing the result to ";" separated txt file.
